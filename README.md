# GABLS3-CFDWindSCM: Assessment of meso-micro offline coupling methodology based on driving CFDWind single-column-model with WRF tendencies: the GABLS3 diurnal cycle case

In this repository you can find the jupyter notebook that was used to post-process CFDWindSCM simulations of the GABLS3 diurnal cycle case. Based on this work a Windbench benchmark for wind energy applications was designed:

The input data can be fetched from the EUDAT repository:

and the validation data from the original GABLS3 website at KNMI:

The results were published in the following journal paper:
