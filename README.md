In this repository you can find the jupyter notebook that was used to post-process CFDWindSCM simulations of the GABLS3 diurnal cycle case. Based on this work a Windbench benchmark for wind energy applications was designed:

The input data can be fetched from the EUDAT repository: 
http://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.22e419b663cb4ffca8107391b6716c1b 

and the validation data from the original GABLS3 website at KNMI:

The results were published in the following journal paper:
